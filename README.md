# Simple-Kohonen-network

## Description

A very simple implementation of a Kohonen network to cluster given vectors into two classes; patient and control.
The text files 'patient' and 'control' are given to the network in the learning phase to learn the weights associated with each node.

A file named 'zain', unknown to the network, is then provided in the testing phase to identify the vectors as either
control or patients.
